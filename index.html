          <p style="font-size:24px">Since the beginning of time, humanity has always looked for more. Simply because more allows them to live their lives better and better. By the end of the 1900s, electricity had been extensively experimented with, and the first household usages were becoming commonplace.</p>
          <p style="font-size:24px">Though its uptake was slow globally, electricity has fundamentally changed our lives for the better, especially aspects that affect quality of life. Here, we can use datasets to view specific aspects and see how they affect our lives and the future.</p>
          <small>Datasets from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/" target="_blank">ourworldindata.org</a> adapted from various sources including the World Bank;  <a href="https://github.com/AadhesharjunS/narrativecs416" target="_blank">Git</a></small>
